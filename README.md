## Magnetic Forms


</div>

### Description

Modified from Benjamin Wilger's original source. Gives forms a Winamp-like docking behavior. I have added support to make the forms move together when docked, just as in Winamp. Previously, the windows would dock to each other, but not move together. This version adds the option of making one form the "master" of the other docked forms, so that when the master form is dragged, forms docked to it are dragged as well.

Many, many thanks to Benjamin Wilger for his code, without which this version would not exist. (See http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=27489&lngWId=1 for the original code.)

Please cast a positive vote if you enjoy this code. It only takes a few seconds, and I feel less like I'm operating in a vacuum here.
